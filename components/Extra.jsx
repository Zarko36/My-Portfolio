                        <p className="text-neutral-200 mb-4">As a computer science graduate, I have always been passionate about expanding my knowledge and skills beyond the classroom. Throughout my academic career, I have been actively involved in various extracurricular activities, including hackathons, coding clubs, and volunteer work. I have participated in several hackathons, where I had the opportunity to work on innovative projects and collaborate with like-minded individuals. I was also an active member of the coding club at my university, where I honed my programming skills and helped other students with their coding-related queries. Apart from these, I have also volunteered for various social causes, including teaching coding to underprivileged children and contributing to open-source projects. These experiences have not only helped me develop a well-rounded personality but also given me a chance to apply my technical skills to real-world problems. I believe that such experiences are essential for computer science graduates as they provide an opportunity to work in a team, develop problem-solving skills, and gain practical experience in the field.</p>
